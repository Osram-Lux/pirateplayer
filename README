Pirateplayer depends upon Qt4 and librtmp (part of Rtmpdump).

Unix/Linux:

1) Run 'qmake' (optionally 'qmake PREFIX=yourdir' for custom prefix [default: /usr/local/]).
2) Run 'make'.
3) Optionally run 'make clean' to remove files created during compilation.
4) Run 'make install' as root to install.

..and you're done! To uninstall: run 'make uninstall' as root.
